#### Edits/Suggestions
There are a few issues with your HTML and CSS
- The &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt; tag is mistyped
- Be careful to close all HTML tags: Your &lt;link&gt; tag is not closed properly
- Your CSS looks great overall style-wise. Nice job here. Hint: You only need to add <code>font-family: "Montserrat";</code> to <code>body</code>, and it will apply to all of the elements within. Also, consider adding a fallback font-family just in case the Google Font does not load. That would look something like this: <code>font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;</code>

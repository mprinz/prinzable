### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Nice job here, it looks like you have a clear direction upon which you can base your design and development. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. You Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits/Suggestions
There are a few issues with your HTML and CSS
- The &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt; tag is mistyped
- Be careful to close all HTML tags: Your &lt;link&gt; tag is not closed properly
- Your CSS looks great overall style-wise. Nice job here. Hint: You only need to add <code>font-family: "Montserrat";</code> to <code>body</code>, and it will apply to all of the elements within. Also, consider adding a fallback font-family just in case the Google Font does not load. That would look something like this: <code>font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;</code> 

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10008; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Nice job overall on this Milestone, ~~but I cannot pass this with the wireframes missing.~~ Your sitemap, content strategy, and interaction flow are all good. Consider adding some information regarding web projects that you have built and/or worked on to your Professional Info page.

~~Please complete the wireframes before beginning development on your PWP, and notify me so I can pass this Milestone.~~

Nice job overall. I had a litle bit of a hard time differentiating where one wireframe ended, and another one began, but these are nicely done. The mobile wireframe is missing. There will be some differentiation in your layout on desktop and mobile. This layout will be a breeze in Bootstrap, and if well coded, the mobile layout should be work out-of-the-box, no problem.

For your pictures and artwork, the [Swipebox Gallery plugin](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) might be a good option. It works very nicely on mobile.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/), due to the missing mobile layout. Add mobile layout wireframes and I'll bump it up to Tier II. You're clear to start development on your PWP.

### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Nice job here, it looks like you have a clear direction upon which you can base your design and development. Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. You Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits/Suggestions
There are a few issues with your HTML and CSS
- The &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt; tag is mistyped
- Be careful to close all HTML tags: Your &lt;link&gt; tag is not closed properly
- Your CSS looks great overall style-wise. Nice job here. Hint: You only need to add <code>font-family: "Montserrat";</code> to <code>body</code>, and it will apply to all of the elements within. Also, consider adding a fallback font-family just in case the Google Font does not load. That would look something like this: <code>font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;</code> 

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10008; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Nice job overall on this Milestone, but I cannot pass this with the wireframes missing. Your sitemap, content strategy, and interaction flow are all good. Consider adding some information regarding web projects that you have built and/or worked on to your Professional Info page.  

Please complete the wireframes before beginning development on your PWP, and notify me so I can pass this Milestone. [PWP Evaluation Rubric](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

		<h2>Sitemap</h2>
		<p>Mike's personal web site will contain 3 pages. They will be: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Welcome page</li>
			<li>Professional information page</li>
			<li>Personal information page</li>
		</ul>
			<h3>Welcome page</h3>
				<p>The Welcome page will be the home page and the first page a visitor will see.
				It will not contain a lot of content and be somewhat minimalist in its appearance.
				The Welcome page will feature Michael's name in a prominent position and have navigation bar buttons to access the two other pages on the site.
				There will also be a "contact" section where visitors can leave their name, email and a comment.</p>

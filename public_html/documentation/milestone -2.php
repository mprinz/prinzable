		<h1>Sitemap</h1>
		<p>Mike's personal web site will contain 3 pages. They will be: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Welcome page</li>
			<li>Professional information page</li>
			<li>Personal information page</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Welcome page</h2>
		<p>The Welcome page will be the home page and the first page a visitor will see.
			It will not contain a lot of content and be somewhat minimalist in its appearance.
			The Welcome page will feature Michael's name in a prominent position and have navigation bar buttons to access
			the two other pages on the site.</p>

		<h3>Professional information page</h3>
		<p>The Professional page will contain Mike's resume and some information about current projects he is working on.</p>
		<img src="../images/wireframe_2.svg" alt="wireframe_2">
		<h3>Personal information page</h3>
		<p>The Personal page will contain some personal information about Mike, including a brief biography and his
			interests/hobbies.
			There will be some images of Mike's photos and perhaps a drawing he has done.</p>

		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>The welcome page will have a pleasing background image but this image will be slightly faded so it does not
			stand out too much.
			Then will be the name of the designer, me! This will be in the top center of the page. This is intended to draw
			attention to the name and to convey confidence about it. It will then be followed by a brief biographic
			statement of rougly 100 characters.
			Under the bio will be two buttons labeled "professional" and "personal". These buttons will take you to the two
			other pages of the website.
		<h3>Professional page</h3>
		<p>This page will contain Mike's resume but in a modern style.</p>
		<h3>Personal page</h3>
		<p>This page will feature a photo of Mike, probably a headshot. There will be a brief statment about Mike's
			personal interests and perhaps an interesting experience or story he can share. This is intented to portray him
			as an interesting and intelligent person who you would want to hire.</p>

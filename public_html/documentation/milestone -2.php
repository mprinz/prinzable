				There will also be a "contact" section where visitors can leave their name, email and a comment.</p>
			<h3>Professional information page</h3>

			<h3>Personal information page</h3>
				<p>The Personal page will contain some personal information about Mike, including a brief biography and his interests/hobbies.
				There will be some images of Mike's photos and perhaps a drawing he has done.</p>
